# rockstor-silvergrade-rockons
Forked and semi-manual Rock-ons plugins for Rockstor NAS linux server.

Add these to your server </opt/rockstor/rockons-metastore> directory.

These created by me Rock-Ons "wrappers" need partionally manual install job to work,
because Rockstor plugin system is somewhat limited to combine all in to one container.
